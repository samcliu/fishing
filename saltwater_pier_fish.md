# Saltwater Pier Fish

* __Mackerel__ make great bait for larger fish as they bleed a lot. You can catch them easily when they're swarming using a japanese _sabiki rig._ They are also good to eat but you want to make sure to put them on ice right away as they spoil quickly. You can also clean them early to keep the meat from spoiling; apparently the gills rot quickly.
* __King Salmon__ can actually be caught at Pacifica Pier in northern California! This is not something you should expect for most ocean piers however.
* __Striped Bass__ are a common target from northern california piers. They're also known as _stripers_. They swim to and from freshwater to saltwater.
* __Surfperch__ refers to a family of fishes that have a sort of oblong shape. Here is a list of common california [surfperches](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36617&inline). They include walleye, redtail, shiners, and rainbows.
