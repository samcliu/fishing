# Fishing Lures

Lures are non-organic things you use to entice fish to bite, generally by making them think
they're after a worm or a baitfish.

As it turns out, lures are just as effective as live baits in most cases, but you have to know
how to use them correctly (particularly casting baits, as opposed to crankbaits).

I personally am starting to like lures more than baits for a few reasons:

1. Lures don't get snagged on seaweed as much when you're surfcasting.
2. They are their own weight: no additional lead weights needed and time spent detangling slider rigs tossed by the surf!
3. They generally lead to an active fishing style which is really fun, if a little strenuous. But it's great exercise.
4. You can get creative with them and use different kinds based on what water you're fishing in. For example, you might use a diver when you are casting into deeper surf, or a floater when the surf is not as rough and fish are striking more in shallows. For spoon lures you can paint your own or add reflective stickers or whatever you think will make it more enticing for fish.

There are many kinds of lures. Some will require that you use a baitcaster (or "caster") rod
instead of a common "spinning" rod. This is because for lures to work, you generally want them
to emulate some living creature (usually a small baitfish).

There are (2) main classifications of baits that groups them by how they're used: jerkbaits and crankbaits. There's also a category that doesn't fit nicely with the other two, called ripbaits. They're described below.

## Jerkbaits

These are lures that are used with baitcasting rods. You cast them out, then move them around by
doing a "jerk-jerk-pause" kind of pattern. If you use a spinning rod, this will cause a lot of
loose loops around your reel (though _technically_ you can use jerkbaits with a spinning rod).
Casting rods eliminate the issue of having loose line coils that lead to tangles with a
spinning reel.

Most jerkbaits are _ripbaits_.

### Plugs

[Plugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_(fishing)) are lures with a hard body. They're popular for ocean fishing. Sometimes baitfish-imitating plugs are called "Minnows" -- a really popular surfcasting plug is the [Daiwa SP Minnow](https://www.amazon.com/Diawa-Minnow-DSPM15F24-Blue-mackerel/dp/B003ZZBECU). Plugs have various kinds of action -- for example I have one with beads inside that roll around and cause the plug to look more fishlike as you reel it in. Plugs all have a lip that controls the movement of the lure as it's being reeled: some stay on the surface (floaters) and move up and down there, whereas others move up and down low in the water (sinkers).

### Spoons

[Spoon lures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_lure) are lures that look nothing like fish but are mainly to reflect light  and encourage bites through erratic motion. You want to use these on sunny days and you don't want to let them sink at all; start reeling as soon as they hit the water. I have some larger saltwater spoons as well as small freshwater spoons. You can troll with them by pulling them behind a moving boat as well.

### Swimbaits

These are lures that have segments and are designed to look like swimming fish. You sort of have to move them around in still water, otherwise I've caught stuff on them in the ocean just from the ocean water moving. [Example of a swimbait](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Gill-Panfish-Talipia-Fishing/dp/B00RC9A66A).

### Ripbaits

There is some contention / confusion as to whether ripbaits are something separate from jerkbaits
or just a broader classification, but generall _Ripbait_ is just a term for any bait that works
best when ripped fast and hard, to imitate a fish swimming quickly. This can apply to either
jerkbaits and crankbaits, the two kinds of baits. But you'll often see people comparing ripbaits
to jerkbaits as if they were two categorizations also, in which case they're mostly comparing the
_presentation_ of the bait (using the jerking pattern vs a fast / hard ripping motion with pauses
between rips).

For example, I've heard someone describe a jerkbait as being a ripbait in certain seasons
and not in others.

## Crankbaits

Crankbaits can be used both with casting and spinning reels. The idea behind a crankbait is you cast it as far as you can, then slowly crank it back. Then do it again and again. The only way to fish a crankbait wrong is to fish it at the wrong depth.

There are some guidelines for using crankbaits well, especially for bass fishing:

* When bass fishing, keep your rod pointed 45 degrees downward rather than 90 degrees perpendicular
to the water. This helps you set your hook in the bass's mouth quicker than if you have to lower the
rod first, which gives the bass time to get away.
* When bass fishing with crankbaits you also want to keep your rod low during the fight so as to
discourage the bass from jumping. One technique I saw described getting down on one knee.
