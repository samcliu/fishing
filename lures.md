# Fishing Lures

Lures are non-organic things you use to entice fish to bite, generally by making them think
they're after a worm or a baitfish.

As it turns out, lures are just as effective as live baits in most cases, but you have to know
how to use them correctly (particularly casting baits, as opposed to crankbaits).

There are many kinds of lures. Some will require that you use a baitcaster (or "caster") rod
instead of a common "spinning" rod. This is because for lures to work, you generally want them
to emulate some living creature (usually a small baitfish).

There are generally (2) kinds of baits: jerkbaits and crankbaits. There's also a category that
doesn't fit nicely with the other two, called ripbaits. They're described below.

## Jerkbaits

These are lures that are used with baitcasting rods. You cast them out, then move them around by
doing a "jerk-jerk-pause" kind of pattern. If you use a spinning rod, this will cause a lot of
loose loops around your reel (though _technically_ you can use jerkbaits with a spinning rod).
Casting rods eliminate the issue of having loose line coils that lead to tangles with a
spinning reel.

Most jerkbaits are _ripbaits_.

### Ripbaits

There is some contention / confusion as to whether ripbaits are something separate from jerkbaits
or just a broader classification, but generall _Ripbait_ is just a term for any bait that works
best when ripped fast and hard, to imitate a fish swimming quickly. This can apply to either
jerkbaits and crankbaits, the two kinds of baits. But you'll often see people comparing ripbaits
to jerkbaits as if they were two categorizations also, in which case they're mostly comparing the
_presentation_ of the bait (using the jerking pattern vs a fast / hard ripping motion with pauses
between rips).

For example, I've heard someone describe a jerkbait as being a ripbait in certain seasons
and not in others.

## Crankbaits

Crankbaits are your less exciting normal baits that you put into the water and crank up.
They are generally used with spinning rods.

There are some guidelines for using crankbaits well, especially for bass fishing:

* When bass fishing, keep your rod pointed 45 degrees downward rather than 90 degrees perpendicular
to the water. This helps you set your hook in the bass's mouth quicker than if you have to lower the
rod first, which gives the bass time to get away.
* When bass fishing with crankbaits you also want to keep your rod low during the fight so as to
discourage the bass from jumping. One technique I saw described getting down on one knee.
