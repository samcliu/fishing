# Fishing Rods

## Reels

### Spinning Reels

A spinning reel is probably the most common type of fishing rod among anglers,
especially those going after small to medium-sized fish like bass, redfish, and crappie.
These reels have a fixed spool underneath the rod, and line is drawn out by the weight of
the lure, bait, or tackle.

#### Benefits of a Spinning Reel

All around versatility is the biggest reason people choose spinning reels. They can be used
to cast many different types of tackle, including artificial lures and live bait. Because
they only need to pull the weight of the fishing line, spinning reels are especially useful
for light tackle and bait.

#### Drawbacks of a Spinning Reel

While spinning reels are great for casting practically everything in your tackle box, they don’t
always provide the best effectiveness for heavy lures. They are also not as accurate as
baitcasters, so experienced bass anglers use them sparingly.

If you are just getting started in fishing, a versatile and easy-to-use spinning reel is probably
your best option.

### Baitcaster Reels

Baitcasters, also known as “bait casting reels”, are for the more experienced anglers who want better
control and accuracy. With a baitcaster, the spool rotates as you cast, meaning the inertia has to be
strong enough to move the spool but not so strong that it creates a rat’s nest. These types of reels
require experience and skill, often requiring a full season’s worth or practice before they can be used
effectively.

#### Benefits of a Baitcaster

The number one advantage for a baitcaster is accuracy. After hours of practice with a baitcaster,
you’ll be able to put a lure exactly where you want it. You’ll also be able to stop the lure on a dime,
meaning bad casts that are headed for a snag can be swiftly recovered.

#### Drawbacks of a Baitcaster

You need patience to use a baitcaster effectively. At first, it will seem impossible to cast correctly,
and if you don’t stop the spool after the lure lands, the line keeps feeding out, creating a frustrating
mess. They are also used for lures alone, so they don’t have the versatility of other reels.

When you are ready to upgrade your fishing and increase your accuracy, consider purchasing a baitcaster.
