# Fishing Rods



## Reels

There are [many kinds of reels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_reel#Types_of_fishing_reels) but
the ones to know aren't too many and talked about below.

### Spinning Reels

A spinning reel is probably the most common type of fishing rod among anglers,
especially those going after small to medium-sized fish like bass, redfish, and crappie.
These reels have a fixed spool underneath the rod, and line is drawn out by the weight of
the lure, bait, or tackle.

#### Benefits of a Spinning Reel

All around versatility is the biggest reason people choose spinning reels. They can be used
to cast many different types of tackle, including artificial lures and live bait. Because
they only need to pull the weight of the fishing line, spinning reels are especially useful
for light tackle and bait.

#### Drawbacks of a Spinning Reel

While spinning reels are great for casting practically everything in your tackle box, they don’t
always provide the best effectiveness for heavy lures. They are also not as accurate as
baitcasters, so experienced bass anglers use them sparingly.

If you are just getting started in fishing, a versatile and easy-to-use spinning reel is probably
your best option.

### Baitcaster Reels

Baitcasters, also known as “bait casting reels”, are for the more experienced anglers who want better
control and accuracy. With a baitcaster, the spool rotates as you cast, meaning the inertia has to be
strong enough to move the spool but not so strong that it creates a rat’s nest. These types of reels
require experience and skill, often requiring a full season’s worth or practice before they can be used
effectively.

#### Benefits of a Baitcaster

The number one advantage for a baitcaster is accuracy. After hours of practice with a baitcaster,
you’ll be able to put a lure exactly where you want it. You’ll also be able to stop the lure on a dime,
meaning bad casts that are headed for a snag can be swiftly recovered.

#### Drawbacks of a Baitcaster

You need patience to use a baitcaster effectively. At first, it will seem impossible to cast correctly,
and if you don’t stop the spool after the lure lands, the line keeps feeding out, creating a frustrating
mess. They are also used for lures alone, so they don’t have the versatility of other reels.

When you are ready to upgrade your fishing and increase your accuracy, consider purchasing a baitcaster.

### Fly Reel

Flyfishing is an angling method in which an artificial "fly" is used to catch fish. So this is geared toward
surface fishing, and requires special casting techniques to cast a nearly weightless fly lure. It seems
difficult and I think I prefer other kinds of fishing so I'm not going to write more about it.

## Reel Components

There are (2) main components that contribute to the quality of a reel.

### Drag System

Drag systems apply variable pressure to the line spool in order to act as a friction brake against it.
This gives resistance to the line after hooking a fish to aid in landing the fish without the line breaking.
If you use good fishing technique and your rod's flex, this allows larger fish to be caught than the straight
breaking strength of the line!

Good drag systems are consistent, durable, and smooth. That means

1. They should always generate the same force
2. They shouldn't break
3. They shouldn't be jerky in operation

The more "drag washers" (bearings) that your drag system has, the better it will probably be.

Experienced fishers actually set the drag for their rods. If you're a beginner, you probably just use whatever
the rod came with.

From Wikipedia: 

> With spinning reels, closed-face reels and conventional reels with star drags, a good starting point
> is to set the drag to about one-third to one-half the breaking strength of the line. For example, if
> the line is rated at 20-pound-force (89 N) test, a drag setting that requires 7–10 pounds-force (31–44 N)
> of force on the line to move the spool would be appropriate.

### Gears

Gear ratio says how fast the line will come in when you crank. If you're casting a lot and trying to emulate
some kind of fish with your lure, you might want a slower reel. If you're using rip bait, you might want a
faster reel. 5:1 is considered average speed. Higher would be faster (6:1, 7:1), lower would be slower (3:1, 2:1).
