# Sam's Guide to Fishing for Beginners
*June 09, 2016*

## Introduction
A couple of months ago my partner and I went on a fishing trip on the bay: we caught a 17" Striped Bass (1" under the 18" limit), as well as an 8lbs Halibut that we later seasoned and had for dinner. We didn't do much besides ride the boat, hook bait, plop them in the water when told to, and reel them up. It was the perfect way to get hooked on fishing though!

Seized with the fishing bug, I went out and bought a bunch of fishing equipment from [Gus's Discount Tackle](http://www.gusdiscounttackle.com), which is one of the few fishing shops in San Francisco. There is another shop to the south, but I was in Sunset so I tried out a few things and decided on two $30 rods good for saltwater pier and freshwater fishing. The store owner Steph recommended that I try powerbait for freshwater trout and catfish, and gave me the correct sized (small) hooks. She gave me some larger hooks and weights for saltwater pier fishing, saying I should use some chicken liver or live baitfish when trying that. Seems like people here use anchovies most frequently.

The next weekend I went to [Pacifica Pier](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacifica+Municipal+Pier/@37.6333788,-122.498441,17z). Apparently you don't need a [California State Fishing License](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing) to fish from municipal piers. It was really crowded however and it seemed like a lot of waiting in windy / cold conditions to fish on a pier. We decided against fishing there, and made other plans to find a decent place to test out our rods.

Shannon scouted out a reservoir that might be a good place to start: [Lafayette Reservoir](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lafayette+Reservoir+Recreation+Area/@37.8847926,-122.145527,15z) between Oakland and Walnut Creek. We rented a rowboat for the day (~$20) and spent our time trying not to drift too close to the reeds, clanging around and throwing baited hooks down at different depths for hours.

We really didn't know what we were doing though. So I started to do some research, but there's a lot to learn and a lot of fishing terms! I'll keep all the information I learn about fishing in this document.

As of June 9, 2016: I've been fishing 3 times. This is just a collection of information I've compiled from research and a few trips.

## Lake Fishing

There are two main ways to fish in a lake. The first is using a boat -- this can be an inflatable, a row boat, a kayak or a boat with a motor. The second is sitting at the docks in a camping chair. The first method is preferable because you can get to where the fish are; they're pretty dumb and if you want to catch things it's easier if you put bait right in front of them.

### Freshwater Baits

#### Powerbait

[Powerbait](https://www.amazon.com/Berkley-Powerbait-Glitter-Rainblow-1-75-Ounce/dp/B0000AV1L0) is mush that you put on your hook and hope the fish swallows whole. You don't want to make balls of powerbait too large because fish might nibble at it and never get hooked. Also most trout mouths aren't actually that big. Only farm-raised fish will eat powerbait, because other fish aren't accustomed to eating pellets. I honestly didn't have much success with powerbait but have seen testimonials and pictures from others who've caught pretty large fish using it. I have some so I'll keep trying, but at this point I favor live bait much more.

#### Nightcrawlers (Earthworms)

The first thing I learned about earthworms is that many fishermen call them "nightcrawlers." There are multiple sizes of earthworms, and places that sell them will usually offer a few varieties. Worms are pretty gross, according to everyone. But fish really like them! We had bluegills come with a lot of interest in our worms! But most of them made away with the bait to date; I still have to get better at hooking them.

##### How to correctly hook nightcrawlers

So the advice I heard from a friendly man at the reservoir was that you want to hook through the _collar_ of the worm (the thickest part), then hook a piece of the end. I was also told to cut / pinch off part of the worm so fish have to bite near the hook. Also smaller fish can't fit a whole worm in their mouth, so your options are to use smaller worms or again reduce the size of your worm by cutting. I always bring a pair of scissors to fishing, but I also squeezed off one end of a worm before. It's pretty gross.

#### Red Worms

Apparently there is another kind of worm called a red worm -- little fish that stay in shallower water / near the surface (a la [Bluegill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegill), [Crappies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crappie) and other [Sunfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrarchidae)) are more likely to eat these worms because they're smaller and wiggle _less_. But if there's one thing you should know about any live bait, it's that the wiggling attracts fish. So make sure you get worms that are actually alive and wiggly.

#### Mealworms

I used to feed [mealworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealworm) to my pet lizards when I was in middle school. They're really gross looking but apparently safe for humans to eat, capable of breaking down styrofoam polystyrene back into organic material, and they make great bait for smaller fish.

### Trolling Motors

#### TL;DR
TL;DR you'll probably spend $160 (trolling motor) + $50 (fancy battery charger) + $100 (deep cycle marine battery) + $50 (optional-ish battery case / circuit breaker) = $360 if you want to get into the trolling motor game. If you're not ready to drop that kind of dough, maybe stick to fishing on a pier or dock for a while, though personally I think $360 for a bunch of equipment that you'll use for a really long time is actually pretty affordable, amortized cost and all! The only thing that you'll ever have to replace is the battery and it's good for a really long time. You can also try to get components that were cheaper than the ones I got though I'm really happy with my purchases and think if you have a little cash to spare it's probably worth it.

#### Why Use a Trolling Motor
Clanging around in a rowboat is suboptimal:
* Clanging scares fish.
* The current set us adrift and it was hard to maintain good position.
* Getting back to shore was really exhausting. Fishing is tiring as it is.

We noticed that someone else brought an attachable motor and was motoring their rowboat around -- turns out this is called a *trolling motor*. I wanted one really bad so I hit Amazon & [camelcamelcamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com) to price compare.

The one I purchased for use on row boats and inflatables was the [Minn Kota Endura C2 40 Freshwater Transom Mounted Trolling Motor (36" Shaft)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043H31GG). It came in an intimidatingly large box, but isn't actually that big and weighs maybe 15lbs; it's very transportable and easy to set up. I stuck the telescoping handle into the body to set it up (...didn't quite read instructions until doing that and realizing it's a one-time permanent operation), but there wasn't much else I needed the instructions for. It clamps on to the back of a row boat or other lake vessel (works with some ~$150-200 inflatable boats like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Sevylor-Fish-Hunter-Inflatable-4-Person/dp/B0032GM1QA); brand names Sevylor and Intex are both pretty common).

#### Deep Cycle Marine Batteries

Trolling motors are generally battery powered. Shannon and I spent ~6 hours out on the lake and used less than 1/4 of our group 24 battery. What I learned about batteries is as follows:

* Batteries are rated in "groups" -- for marine trolling batteries you're probably looking for a group 24 or group 27 battery. These numbers define the physical dimensions of the battery case and is important because some applications may require specific case sizes. The BCI does not determine the Amp Hours (AH) rating for the batteries, but there is a correlation between case size and AH rating. For deep cycle batteries, the larger the case size the more capacity the battery will usually have.
* Batteries are heavy. Mine is a Duracell Group 24M 75AH Marine Deep Cycle battery, and it weighs close to 50lbs.
* Wet cell batteries like these need to be constantly plugged in if you want them to be maintained / not go bad. That means either leaving it plugged in, in a garage, or if you live in a studio like I do...I charge it under your desk? It's huge. I kinda wish I could leave it somewhere I wasn't breathing the same air as it or risking an explosion -- I might move it to a friend's garage at some point. I bought a fancy [Minn Kota Battery Charger and Maintainer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MN8SEK) that has advanced features like __not blowing up when you attach the cables the wrong way.__ Derp.
* You probably want to know how much power you have left as you're motoring through some massive lake. Thankfully I purchased a [Minn Kota Battery Power Center](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PTHKMG) which has that, and a circut breaker specifically perfect for trolling motors. Knowing approximately nothing about boats or fishing I decided to get slightly nice stuff from what seems to be a brand name that has good reviews on Amazon.
* "Deep Cycle" refers to the fact that these batteries can withstand getting depleted and recharged (deep cycled) many times.
* "Deep Cycle _Marine_" just means the battery has what they call "cold cranking amps" -- this is needed because more power is needed to first start your motor, then some electricity to sustain. Car and motorcycle engine batteries give starting power but then your car runs on gas, so they don't need to give sustained power...thus they're not a good option / won't work for trolling motors. I was sad to hear this because aluminum 12v batteries are SUPER LIGHT weight-wise. Battery guy said I'd have to wait another 20 years or so before I could get something like that for my trolling motor.
* Amazon doesn't have great options for deep cycle marine batteries. I bought mine at a local store called "Batteries + Bulbs" (that's all they sell)!

### Fish Finders / Fish Sonar

Being in a boat is only an advantage if you don't scare off all the fish, or if you know where to put your boat (where all the fish are). For that reason, I picked up a "transom-mount fish sonar" for ~$120, the [Garmin Striker 4 Fish Sonar](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-01550-00-Striker-4/dp/B017NI17HQ).

If you're trying to find fish from the land, a fish sonar like the one I bought is probably not good. You'd need to either find a castable transducer (which I have not seen on the market for my sonar) OR buy something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/iBobber-Wireless-Bluetooth-Android-devices/dp/B00LEA2FS0) which seems to have terrible reviews. I don't know if you can just manually hold your transducer in the water and see if there are fish; I suspect it doesn't work too well because transducers are directional.

## Pier Fishing

TODO(samliu): I know approximately nothing about pier fishing. I did pick up two coleman camping chairs for $7 from a Walmart Slickdeal though!
