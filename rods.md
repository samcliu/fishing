# Fishing Rods

## Cost & Quality Factors

Factors that affect how much your rod cost:

* Strength before breaking
* Casting distance
* Overall weight
* Sensitivity

## Lure Weight

Fishing rods have rated lure weight that say how many ounces of lure / weight you can add. 2-6oz is considered the most versatile, though some surf rods will have 3-8+ oz capacity and many lighter rods will have 1-3oz capacity.


## Rod Size

For freshwater fishing you generally want something 7-8ft long that's sensitive and unless you're going for some large
catfish / flatheads you're probably not that worried about strength.

For saltwater pier fishing you generally want a 7-8ft rod for catching baitfish, and/or a 10+ft rod for catching some larger
fish. My first large rod was 11ft and $35 but it was super heavy and couldn't cast very far. Good larger rods run $200+, with the best bang for your buck somewhere between $200-$500. Some cheaper rods like the [Okuma Longitude](https://www.amazon.com/Okuma-Longitude-Surf-Graphite-Rods/dp/B0087OSKBW) are ~$100 and do the job but better ones include: St Croix Surf Mojo / Legend, Shimano Tiralejo, and the Daiwa Coastal Salt Pro.

You want to match your rod to your height / strength: if you're shorter and want to go surf fishing maybe go for a 10" rod, otherwise if you're taller 11", 12", even 12.5" or 13" rods can work. More expensive rods will generally be lighter and/or more sensitive for the same size / strength.
