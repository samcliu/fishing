# Saltwater Bait

## Chum

For pier fishing you want to [chum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumming) the water to make the fish come to you. I suppose the same is true for surf fishing but I don't imagine it's as easy to target a spot of water from the shore.

Good chum can be purchased at your local grocery store. Here are some options:

* Dog food. Empty a can of dog food (e.g purina) into a [compostable bag](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Gallon-Compost-Waste-Bag-25/dp/B001QVH0LO) and tie it up. When you get to your fishing spot, poke holes in the compostable bag with a scissor and chuck it into the water so that the yummies slowly leak out. The compostable bag will be OK for the environment.
* Chicken Liver
* Chicken Gizzard
* Frozen Squid
* Fish remains

As you can imagine the ocean is huge so it's important that your chum stay smelly and near where you're casting. Some people use a burlap sack because it's eco-friendly instead of a compostable bag, and push things like fish guts inside and let it sit in the water. It takes ~30+ minutes at least for fish to start smelling the chum and heading your direction. Chum works for predatory fish like stripers and sharks.

## Live Bait

* Anchovies make great saltwater bait. You can buy a bucket of live anchovies
  but make sure you have something to aerate the water while you're fishing or
  they'll all start to die and be less appealing to your potential catch.
* Mackerel make great live bait for striped bass (stripers)!

## Dead Bait

* Mackerel is fish that gets very bloody. If you catch some mackerel (easiest using a [sabiki rig](https://www.amazon.com/Assorted-Freshwater-Saltwater-Interlock-Connector/dp/B00QLG01XI/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1468821772&sr=1-3&keywords=sabiki+rig)) you can chum the water by cutting their heads off and throwing them back in. You can also use them as live bait.
* Sand crabs, which can be found on the beach if you dig around.
* Jacksmelt can be quartered and you can use a piece on a hook. The head is great apparently; beware tails because sometimes big fish (stripers) will nibble at the tail first and be more cautious.
