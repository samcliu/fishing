# Fishing Reels

There are [many kinds of reels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_reel#Types_of_fishing_reels) but
the ones to know aren't too many and talked about below.

### Spinning Reels

Spinning reels are the most common reel and the one most think of when we talk about fishing.
They're most used for small to medium-sized fish like bass, redfish, and crappie.
These reels have a fixed spool underneath the rod, and line is drawn out by the weight of
the lure, bait, or tackle. They're the easiest kind of reel to use.

When you cast with a spinning reel, you lift the bail (the bar on the reel) and the weight of
the tackle pulls string off the reel. The reel does NOT spin as line comes off it; it only
spins when you're retrieving line.

That means you can throw your tackle into the water, then wait for it to land and float or sink,
close your bail, and you're ready to wait for some fish. I emphasize this because it's not true
for non-spinning reels.

#### Benefits of a Spinning Reel

_All around versatility_ is the biggest reason people choose spinning reels. They can be used
to cast many different types of tackle, including artificial lures and live bait.

#### Drawbacks of a Spinning Reel

While spinning reels are great for casting practically everything in your tackle box, they don’t
always provide the best effectiveness for heavy lures. They are also not as __accurate__ as
baitcasters, so experienced bass anglers use them sparingly.

If you are just getting started in fishing, a versatile and easy-to-use spinning reel is probably
your best option.

### Baitcaster Reels

Baitcasting reels (also known as baitcasters), are more difficult reels to use.
Unlike a spinning reel, the _spool rotates as you cast_. This adds a new
dimension of difficulty to casting: you have to stop the spool when the lure / bait lands so that you
don't release too much line. These reels also look a bit different (the spool is sideways):

#### Benefits of a Baitcaster

With practice, you get more overall accuracy with a baitcaster as well as some added casting distance.
Because the reel rotates as you cast, there's no inertia keeping line from coming off the reel except
for what you add by either using built-in brakes and/or your thumb (also called "thumbing"). Since you
can stop line from coming off the reel at any time, you have an added degree of control.

Baitcaster reels : spinning reels :: stick shift : automatic transmission.

Maybe not as dramatic as that, but definitely a step up skillwise.

#### Drawbacks of a Baitcaster

You need patience to use a baitcaster effectively. At first, it will seem impossible to cast correctly,
and if you don’t stop the spool after your bait / lure lands, the line keeps feeding out.

One fallacy that people give is that you can't cast bait with a baitcaster (that it's for lures only). This
turns out to be false. If you think about it logically there's not really a reason why you can't attach bait
instead of a lure.

### Fly Reel

Flyfishing is a surface fishing technique that relies on your casting the weight of the line instead of
the weight of your tackle. Terminal tackle for fly fishing is almost weightless (a "fly lure"). It seems
difficult and I think I prefer other kinds of fishing so I'm not going to write more about it.

## Reel Components

There are (2) main components that contribute to the quality of a reel.

### Drag System

Drag systems apply variable pressure to the line spool in order to act as a friction brake against it.
This gives resistance to the line after hooking a fish to aid in landing the fish without the line breaking.
If you use good fishing technique and your rod's flex, this allows larger fish to be caught than the straight
breaking strength of the line!

In simpler terms, when you catch a fish, your line isn't just frozen in place. Line actually goes out. A drag
system determines how quickly it goes out -- not as fast as if you're just casting it, but not zero. If it goes
out super fast you have to reel really hard. If it goes out too slow and you catch a fast-swimming fish, it could
yank your rod out of your hands or break the line.

Good drag systems are consistent, durable, and smooth. That means:

1. They should always generate the same force
2. They shouldn't break
3. They shouldn't be jerky in operation

Very loosely, the more "drag washers" (bearings) that your drag system has, the smoother it is and more pleasant
to use. You set the drag by twising a knob on your reel. Counterclockwise to lessen the drag, clockwise to increase it (lefty loosey righty tighty).

Most casual anglers just kind of feel for the drag system instead of trying to set specific resistances. But it's apparently
possible to set specific resistances:

From Wikipedia: 

> With spinning reels, closed-face reels and conventional reels with star drags, a good starting point
> is to set the drag to about one-third to one-half the breaking strength of the line. For example, if
> the line is rated at 20-pound-force (89 N) test, a drag setting that requires 7–10 pounds-force (31–44 N)
> of force on the line to move the spool would be appropriate.

### Gears

Gear ratio says how fast the line will come in when you crank. If you're casting a lot and trying to emulate
some kind of fish with your lure, you might want a slower reel. If you're using rip bait, you might want a
faster reel. 5:1 is considered average speed. Higher would be faster (6:1, 7:1), lower would be slower (3:1, 2:1).
